I recently moved to a new Windows 10 laptop and experience a number of problems with my &lt;a href="https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/soundlink-around-ear-wireless-headphones-ii.html#v=soundlink_ae_headphones_ii_black" title="https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/soundlink-around-ear-wireless-headphones-ii.html#v=soundlink_ae_headphones_ii_black">Bose SoundLink II&lt;/a>, Bluetooth headphones. Fortunately, after some playing around with drivers I was able to solve my problem and this post explains how…&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Poor sound quality&lt;/strong> – with the default drivers, the sound quality was poor and there was a considerable amount of audible noise being delivered to the headphones via the Bluetooth interface. The audio was very lo-fi and the frequency range was dramatically reduced. This resulted in a very thin, tinny sound.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AWUS036AC (rtl8812au) driver setup in Kali Linux</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/awus036ac-rt8812au-driver-setup-in-kali-linux/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2019 12:34:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/awus036ac-rt8812au-driver-setup-in-kali-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am planning a number of articles which focus on using aircrack-ng and hashcast to recover WPA wireless security passwords. However to get into that you need to have a specific wireless device which supports monitor mode and packet injection. I decided on the Alfa AWUS036AC, but some work was required to get the drivers installed.&lt;/p>

This guide is based on Kali Linux 2019.4 – but the drivers are certified for earlier versions of Kali and the kernel that 2019.4 uses. See updates below for getting this working on Kali 2020.4.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
