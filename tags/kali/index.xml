However to get into that you need to have a specific wireless device which supports monitor mode and packet injection. I decided on the Alfa AWUS036AC, but some work was required to get the drivers installed.&lt;/p>

This guide is based on Kali Linux 2019.4 â€“ but the drivers are certified for earlier versions of Kali and the kernel that 2019.4 uses. See updates below for getting this working on Kali 2020.4.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clipboard and Shared Folders on Kali Linux with VirtualBox</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/clipboard-and-shared-folders-on-kali-linux-with-virtualbox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2019 21:21:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/clipboard-and-shared-folders-on-kali-linux-with-virtualbox/</guid><description>&lt;p>I spent more time that care to admit trying to setup a shared folder between my windows host and Kali VirtualBox VM. So hopefully the Google algos pick this one up and save you the time trying to find the right packages to fix this a clipboard sync.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>apt-get update
apt-get install -y virtualbox-guest-x11
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Go for a quick reboot once the above commands are complete and you should have clipboard sync (text) and shared folders should mount successfully.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
