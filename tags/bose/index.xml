I recently moved to a new Windows 10 laptop and experience a number of problems with my &lt;a href="https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/soundlink-around-ear-wireless-headphones-ii.html#v=soundlink_ae_headphones_ii_black" title="https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/soundlink-around-ear-wireless-headphones-ii.html#v=soundlink_ae_headphones_ii_black">Bose SoundLink II&lt;/a>, Bluetooth headphones. Fortunately, after some playing around with drivers I was able to solve my problem and this post explains how…&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Poor sound quality&lt;/strong> – with the default drivers, the sound quality was poor and there was a considerable amount of audible noise being delivered to the headphones via the Bluetooth interface. The audio was very lo-fi and the frequency range was dramatically reduced. This resulted in a very thin, tinny sound.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
