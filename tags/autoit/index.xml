I’ve spent enough time building VMs in vSphere to know that the first few minutes between starting the VM and getting VMware Tools installed is agonising. Similar to my ‘&lt;a href="https://exitcode0.net/posts/copy-paste-with-powershell-sendkeys/" title="https://exitcode0.net/posts/copy-paste-with-powershell-sendkeys/">Copy Paste With Powershell Sendkeys&lt;/a>‘ script, I have another tool written in AutoIT which sends defined keyboard strokes to the system. So this is not &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> ‘copy paste in vSphere’, but it achieves the same goal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automatically pause Spotify with the 3CX client</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/automatically-pause-spotify-with-the-3cx-client/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 21:35:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/automatically-pause-spotify-with-the-3cx-client/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a really old script that I just found in my archive, but it still works all the same. The goal was to write a small script that would automatically pause Spotify with the &lt;a href="https://www.3cx.com/voip/softphone/" title="https://www.3cx.com/voip/softphone/">3CX client&lt;/a> when there was an inbound call.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The script is written in AutoIT, meaning that it is a Windows-only solution. The Windows 3CX CTI client allows you to run a particular executable when an inbound call is received, i.e. when the phone rings. I wanted to pause the manic euro beats so that I could answer my phone and here the caller and uphold professionalism.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
