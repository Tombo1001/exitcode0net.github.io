A short and sweet problem/resolution. If you are looking to enable subnet overlapping on a Fortigate so that you can give multiple interfaces an IP in the same subnet, this is the post for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NOTE: This feature can only be enabled in the Fortigateâ€™s CLI. To enable the overlapping feature, enter the following commands:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>config system settings
set allow-subnet-overlap [enable/disable]
end
&lt;/code>&lt;/pr</description></item></channel></rss>
