So, here is my guide for updating to the latest version of Python 3 (3.9) on Debian 10 Buster.
To clarify the purpose of this guide, Debian 10 ships with Python 2 (2.7) and Python 3 (3.7) installed at my time of writing. For those wishing to upgrade from python 3.</description></item><item><title>Python 3 SSH with Paramiko</title><link>https://blog.exitcode0.net/posts/python-3-ssh-with-paramiko/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 18:18:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.exitcode0.net/posts/python-3-ssh-with-paramiko/</guid><description>I have a number of projects which I am currently working on which usually involve a raspberry pi and so other TCP enabled object. One project, in particular, is to control a KVM server with buttons connected to a raspberry pi (follow on social media or RSS for that future post). I have been using Python 3 SSH with Paramiko to send commands KVM server from the pi.

There are number of reason that you might want to implement this; a great use case would be outputting a fluctuating variable to the terminal such as a temperature reading from a sensor.
loops that make your brain hurt A ‘while true’ statement allows us to run a sequence of code until a particular condition is met.</description></item><item><title>Python 2.7 end-of-life - The time to upgrade is upon us</title><link>https://blog.exitcode0.net/posts/python-2-7-end-of-life-the-time-to-upgrade-is-upon-us/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2020 02:31:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.exitcode0.net/posts/python-2-7-end-of-life-the-time-to-upgrade-is-upon-us/</guid><description>1st January 2020 marked the official end of python 2.7 development, including feature support and security fixes.
Python 2.7 was over 9 years old in development years, making it the longest supported version to date. The code freeze is no in place, with the final release – 2.7.18 – scheduled for an April 2020 release. So yes there will be one more version to come down the tubes but it’s probably best that the new python project you were thinking of starting is written in 3.</description></item><item><title>Getting started with Python 3 - a beginner's cheat sheet</title><link>https://blog.exitcode0.net/posts/getting-started-with-python-3-a-beginners-cheat-sheet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 21:13:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.exitcode0.net/posts/getting-started-with-python-3-a-beginners-cheat-sheet/</guid><description>Python.Org I have been getting started with python 3 – I want to make this my primary scripting language.

I ran into a number of issues doing this so I though that I would put this quick post together to make this a little bit less complicated for anyone else trying to this.
This post relates specifically to python version 3.7.3. Although the generic commands should also apply to earlier versions, but your milage may vary.</description></item></channel></rss>
