This is part 2 from my previous post on RTX 3060 Nicehash overclocking settings. I don’t want to edit the previous article because the content still stands to be accurate for the hash rate I achieved. However, I have since learned even more about the card and managed to improve my Nicehash quick miner hash rate by a further 10%!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RTX 3060 Nicehash mining overclock settings</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/rtx-3060-nicehash-mining-overclock-settings/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 10:24:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/rtx-3060-nicehash-mining-overclock-settings/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently managed to buy a Gigabyte RTX 3060 without lining the pockets of a scaler, lucky me! I recently discussed how I was able to circumvent the Nvidia crypto mining limitations: &lt;a href="__GHOST_URL__/unlock-rtx-3060-mining-hash-rate/">Unlock RTX 3060 mining hash rate&lt;/a> (that post also includes access to the driver). This doubled the RTX 3060 Nicehash mining rate using the ‘unlocked’ Nvidia beta driver – going from ~22MH/s up to ~40MH/s. Impressive!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I am going to share my RTX 3060 overclock settings, which enabled me to achieve a further 10% uplift in Nicehash performance. But first I must disclaimer that you are responsible for your own hardware and any changes you make are at your own risk. What’s more, modern silicone is a lottery, you might not get these exact mining hash rates, or you might get more; keep an eye on your thermals and protect your card and safety of your system accordingly!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unlock RTX 3060 mining hash rate</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/unlock-rtx-3060-mining-hash-rate/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 11:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/unlock-rtx-3060-mining-hash-rate/</guid><description>&lt;p>There has been lots of news coverage around the recent mistake made by Nvidia with their RTX 3060 driver allowing uninhibited mining hash rates: a great round-up from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333544/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-rate-limit-unlock-driver" title="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333544/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-rate-limit-unlock-driver">The Verge&lt;/a>. A developer driver inadvertently included code used for internal development which removes the hash rate limiter on RTX 3060 in some configurations. The driver has been removed, but there are lots of copies in circulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are still some limitations, you must have a monitor attached and can only run a single RTX 3060 at a time. However, it is only a matter of time before motivated miners get over the remaining hurdles.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
