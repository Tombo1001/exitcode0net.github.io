&lt;strong>WARNING&lt;/strong>: Although this is official, it is still in beta testing, so rock-solid stability is far from certain.

All of the horsepower required for an excellent lower power, docker host.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

However, there are currently issues undergoing work which prevent docker from running on the only Rasbian image currently available for the Pi 4 – ‘&lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/" title="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Rasbian Buster&lt;/a>‘. Details of these issues can been found here on the GitHub thread – &lt;a href="https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/709" title="https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/709">https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/709&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Fear not, for there is a simple way to fool your docker installation and successfully getting it to run on the Pi 4.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using a DHT11 sensor with a raspberry pi</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/using-a-dht11-sensor-with-a-raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2019 18:59:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/using-a-dht11-sensor-with-a-raspberry-pi/</guid><description>&lt;p>This post is going to share how to use DHT11 sensors with a the raspberry pi , using the GPIO pins. Furthermore the particular sensor that I am going to be discussing requires zero soldering and is purely plug and play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Sensor:&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The sensor that we will be using is the DHT11 – the exact variant is the 3 pin version. You can find the exact version that I used here&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
