I have been using the Nextcloud snap package for a long time, but some recent system changes in my colocation facility mean that it is time for a big upgrade. Rather than migrate my existing Nextcloud instance, I have decided to build a new install and here are my goals for the new installation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Use lets encrypt to have automatic and valid HTTPS certificates&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Have the data path for Nextcloud on a HDD and the rest of the host OS on an SSD&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="host-os-details">Host OS Details&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For this setup, I am using Ubuntu 18.04 installed on a 30GB SSD backed partition. I then have a 1TB disk attached and mounted to /media.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Backup Nextcloud with RCLONE</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/backup-nextcloud-with-rclone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:08:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/backup-nextcloud-with-rclone/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve made previous posts about backing cloud services with RCLONE – &lt;a href="https://exitcode0.net/posts/backup-google-photos-with-rclone/" title="https://exitcode0.net/posts/backup-google-photos-with-rclone/">Backup Google Photos with Rclone&lt;/a> – and this post will detail how to backup a self-hosted cloud service, Nextcloud.&lt;/p>

There are a lot of benefits to running your own private ‘cloud’ storage system, but for me, my top concern is privacy and Nextcloud gives me the ability to take accountability for my own data. With this in mind, I am conscious of my Nextcloud server going offline or suffering data loss, so I want a way to create 1 or more backups of my datacentre hosted, Nextcloud data on my home NAS.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
