A developer driver inadvertently included code used for internal development which removes the hash rate limiter on RTX 3060 in some configurations. The driver has been removed, but there are lots of copies in circulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are still some limitations, you must have a monitor attached and can only run a single RTX 3060 at a time. However, it is only a matter of time before motivated miners get over the remaining hurdles.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
