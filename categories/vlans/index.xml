For the most part, the only reference material you will need to complete this configuration can be found here: https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortiap/6.4.0/fortiwifi-and-fortiap-cookbook/252439/configuring-the-fortigate-interface-to-manage-fortiap-units. However, if you have been working with Fortigates and by extension FortiOS for quite some time, you may be wonder where the CAPWAP option vanished to?</description></item><item><title>Fortigate: Add a VLAN to a hardware switch</title><link>https://blog.exitcode0.net/posts/fortigate-add-a-vlan-to-a-hardware-switch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 21:30:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.exitcode0.net/posts/fortigate-add-a-vlan-to-a-hardware-switch/</guid><description>In this post, we are going to discuss how to add a VLAN to a hardware (sometimes referred to as physical) switch or interface on a Fortigate. It is worth noting that I actually do my testing on a FortiWifi, so I can assure you that this also applies there too. I will be focusing on the configuration which is relevant to FortiOS v6.0 and above, so your millage vary between versions.</description></item></channel></rss>
