&lt;p>For the most part, the only reference material you will need to complete this configuration can be found here: &lt;a href="https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortiap/6.4.0/fortiwifi-and-fortiap-cookbook/252439/configuring-the-fortigate-interface-to-manage-fortiap-units" title="https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortiap/6.4.0/fortiwifi-and-fortiap-cookbook/252439/configuring-the-fortigate-interface-to-manage-fortiap-units">https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortiap/6.4.0/fortiwifi-and-fortiap-cookbook/252439/configuring-the-fortigate-interface-to-manage-fortiap-units&lt;/a>. However, if you have been working with Fortigates and by extension FortiOS for quite some time, you may be wonder where the CAPWAP option vanished to? Fortinet adopted this into the security fabric naming convention. CAPWAP has even been replaced in the CLI by ‘fabric’.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fortigate: Add a VLAN to a hardware switch</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/fortigate-add-a-vlan-to-a-hardware-switch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 21:30:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/fortigate-add-a-vlan-to-a-hardware-switch/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/exitcode0.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/fortigate_VLANs-1024x1024.png?resize=227%2C227&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Fortigate: Add a VLAN to a hardware switch - Configuration Example" />
In this post, we are going to discuss how to add a VLAN to a hardware (sometimes referred to as physical) switch or interface on a Fortigate. It is worth noting that I actually do my testing on a FortiWifi, so I can assure you that this also applies there too. I will be focusing on the configuration which is relevant to FortiOS v6.0 and above, so your millage vary between versions. However, you need can usually be found over at the Fortinet Handbook: &lt;a href="https://docs.fortinet.com/product/fortigate/6.0" title="https://docs.fortinet.com/product/fortigate/6.0">https://docs.fortinet.com/product/fortigate/6.0&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
