A short and sweet problem/resolution. If you are looking to enable subnet overlapping on a Fortigate so that you can give multiple interfaces an IP in the same subnet, this is the post for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NOTE: This feature can only be enabled in the Fortigateâ€™s CLI. To enable the overlapping feature, enter the following commands:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>config system settings
set allow-subnet-overlap [enable/disable]
end
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h2 id="what-is-subnet-overlapping">What is subnet overlapping?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Subnet overlapping is disabled by default in fortiOS and for good reason; if you misuse subnet overlapping it can cause massive routing issues for your clients and their traffic. Subnet overlapping lets you apply IPs from the same subnet (e.g 192.160.1.X/24) to multiple interfaces that are not in the same virtual/physical switch.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
