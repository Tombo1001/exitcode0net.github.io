For the most part, the only reference material you will need to complete this configuration can be found here: https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortiap/6.4.0/fortiwifi-and-fortiap-cookbook/252439/configuring-the-fortigate-interface-to-manage-fortiap-units. However, if you have been working with Fortigates and by extension FortiOS for quite some time, you may be wonder where the CAPWAP option vanished to?</description></item><item><title>Fortigate: Add a VLAN to a hardware switch</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/fortigate-add-a-vlan-to-a-hardware-switch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 21:30:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/fortigate-add-a-vlan-to-a-hardware-switch/</guid><description>In this post, we are going to discuss how to add a VLAN to a hardware (sometimes referred to as physical) switch or interface on a Fortigate. It is worth noting that I actually do my testing on a FortiWifi, so I can assure you that this also applies there too. I will be focusing on the configuration which is relevant to FortiOS v6.0 and above, so your millage vary between versions.</description></item><item><title>How to enable subnet overlapping on a Fortigate</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/how-to-enable-subnet-overlapping-on-a-fortigate/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 12:40:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/how-to-enable-subnet-overlapping-on-a-fortigate/</guid><description>A short and sweet problem/resolution. If you are looking to enable subnet overlapping on a Fortigate so that you can give multiple interfaces an IP in the same subnet, this is the post for you.
NOTE: This feature can only be enabled in the Fortigate’s CLI. To enable the overlapping feature, enter the following commands:
config system settings set allow-subnet-overlap [enable/disable] end What is subnet overlapping? Subnet overlapping is disabled by default in fortiOS and for good reason; if you misuse subnet overlapping it can cause massive routing issues for your clients and their traffic.</description></item><item><title>Double NAT port forwarding with a Fortigate</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/double-nat-port-forwarding-with-a-fortigate/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Feb 2019 13:10:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/double-nat-port-forwarding-with-a-fortigate/</guid><description>If you are unfortunate enough to have to deal with double NAT on your gateway then you might know the troubles surrounding portforwarding or VIPs. Here is a quick how to guide for setting up a port forward on a Forgate where double NAT is inplace.
Case Study – Plex port forward
Plex is a great tool for managing your personal media collection and it gets even better when you enable a port forward to let you access this collection from anywhere in the world.</description></item></channel></rss>
