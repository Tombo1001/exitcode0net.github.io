If you are looking to turn off the LED status lights on the TPLink Kasa smart plugs, then look no further – the solution resides in this post. It does involve some Python interaction, but I promise that it is a gentle passing with the programming language.
This solution works for:
HS100 HS103 HS105 HS110 The only real drawback is that when the LED is disabled, you can not see when the device might have become disconnected from the wireless network – this is normally indicated by a RED or orange LED status.</description></item></channel></rss>
