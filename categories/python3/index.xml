I have covered this a number of times in the past and the posts have proved popular and useful to many. So, here is my guide for updating to the latest version of Python 3 (3.9) on Debian 10 Buster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To clarify the purpose of this guide, Debian 10 ships with Python 2 (2.7) and Python 3 (3.7) installed at my time of writing. For those wishing to upgrade from python 3.7.X to 3.8.X or 3.9.X, this is the guide for you. If you are trying to configure python 3.7 as your default interpreter when you call ‘&lt;code>python&lt;/code>‘, try this: &lt;a href="https://exitcode0.net/posts/changing-the-default-python-version-in-debian/" title="https://exitcode0.net/posts/changing-the-default-python-version-in-debian/">CHANGING THE DEFAULT PYTHON VERSION IN DEBIAN&lt;/a>. This method involves using the ‘&lt;code>update-alternatives&lt;/code>‘ command. We will be using a similar method in this guide, however this time we only do so to give 3.9.X a higher priority to 3.7.X, rather than uninstalling older versions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python 3 SSH with Paramiko</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/python-3-ssh-with-paramiko/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 18:18:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/python-3-ssh-with-paramiko/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have a number of projects which I am currently working on which usually involve a raspberry pi and so other TCP enabled object.

There are number of reason that you might want to implement this; a great use case would be outputting a fluctuating variable to the terminal such as a temperature reading from a sensor.&lt;/p>

loops that make your brain hurt
A ‘while true’ statement allows us to run a sequence of code until a particular condition is met. In order to make that sequence of code run in an infinite loop, we can set the condition to be one that is impossible to reach. Better still, we can simply omit the condition altogether to ensure that the while true loop never ends.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python 2.7 end-of-life - The time to upgrade is upon us</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/python-2-7-end-of-life-the-time-to-upgrade-is-upon-us/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2020 02:31:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/python-2-7-end-of-life-the-time-to-upgrade-is-upon-us/</guid><description>&lt;p>1st January 2020 marked the official end of python 2.7 development, including feature support and security fixes.&lt;/p>

Python 2.7 was over 9 years old in development years, making it the longest supported version to date. The code freeze is no in place, with the final release – 2.7.18 – scheduled for an April 2020 release. So yes there will be one more version to come down the tubes but it’s probably best that the new python project you were thinking of starting is written in 3.7 or above.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting started with Python 3 - a beginner's cheat sheet</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/getting-started-with-python-3-a-beginners-cheat-sheet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 21:13:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/getting-started-with-python-3-a-beginners-cheat-sheet/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.python.org/" title="https://www.python.org/">&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/exitcode0.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Python-PNG-Clipart.png?resize=187%2C117" alt="Python Logo" />

I have been getting started with python 3 – I want to make this my primary scripting language. One way I like to assist myself whilst I learn the rope is to maintain a crib sheet filled with all the trivial things I would otherwise forget.&lt;/p>

I recently spent 30 minutes figuring out how to upgrade to python 3.7 and subsequently pip version on a fresh install of Debian 9. I ran into a number of issues doing this so I though that I would put this quick post together to make this a little bit less complicated for anyone else trying to this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post relates specifically to python version 3.7.3. Although the generic commands should also apply to earlier versions, but your milage may vary.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
