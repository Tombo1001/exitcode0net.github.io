This post will walk you through the simple steps needed for customising the PowerShell prompt, including how to show the current date and time.
What exactly do I mean by the PowerShell prompt and what does the typical prompt look like by default?</description></item><item><title>Prevent Screensavers and Lock-screens with Powershell</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/prevent-screensavers-and-lock-screens-with-powershell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 10:33:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/prevent-screensavers-and-lock-screens-with-powershell/</guid><description>There might be a number of reasons to want to prevent your windows screensavers and lock-screens from engaging and in some cases (no doubt yours if you have hit this article from a search engine) local policy on the machine preventing you from changing these settings.
Powershell lets us work around this problem and prevent the machine from locking or activating a screensaver.
Prevent Screensavers and Lock-screens The bulk of the code below has been lifted from this great write up: https://dmitrysotnikov.</description></item><item><title>Modifying Windows shortcuts is Powershell</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/modifying-windows-shortcuts-is-powershell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Feb 2019 09:00:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/modifying-windows-shortcuts-is-powershell/</guid><description>I once faced a rather tedious task that involved recursively modifying a number of shortcut paths stored across a convoluted folder structure. There was approximately 100 shortcuts which needed part of their path modifying.
The answer: Create a****PowerShell script.
The following code utilises regex to check for the existence of a string and modify with the define replacement. It is easily possible to use Read-Host to make this a little bit more interactive, but the purposes of my use-case it was just as simple to modify these variables before running the script.</description></item><item><title>Powershell - Checking the Language Mode</title><link>https://exitcode0.net/posts/powershell-checking-the-language-mode/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2019 09:00:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://exitcode0.net/posts/powershell-checking-the-language-mode/</guid><description>For security purposes, it is possible to control the language mode in a given Powershell session. These language modes can constrict which modules can be loaded during the life of a powershell session.

Perhaps it is a case of a website which prevents text form being sent to a field from the clipboard, or in my case, a windows UAC prompt. If you are following password best practices, your passwords should be long, complex and contain zero dictionary words. Furthermore, you should have a different password for every site and service.</description></item></channel></rss>
