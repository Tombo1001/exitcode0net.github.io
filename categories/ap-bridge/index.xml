&lt;p>For the most part, the only reference material you will need to complete this configuration can be found here: &lt;a href="https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortiap/6.4.0/fortiwifi-and-fortiap-cookbook/252439/configuring-the-fortigate-interface-to-manage-fortiap-units" title="https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortiap/6.4.0/fortiwifi-and-fortiap-cookbook/252439/configuring-the-fortigate-interface-to-manage-fortiap-units">https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortiap/6.4.0/fortiwifi-and-fortiap-cookbook/252439/configuring-the-fortigate-interface-to-manage-fortiap-units&lt;/a>. However, if you have been working with Fortigates and by extension FortiOS for quite some time, you may be wonder where the CAPWAP option vanished to? Fortinet adopted this into the security fabric naming convention. CAPWAP has even been replaced in the CLI by ‘fabric’.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
