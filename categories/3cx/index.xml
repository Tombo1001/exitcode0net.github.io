The goal was to write a small script that would automatically pause Spotify with the &lt;a href="https://www.3cx.com/voip/softphone/" title="https://www.3cx.com/voip/softphone/">3CX client&lt;/a> when there was an inbound call.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The script is written in AutoIT, meaning that it is a Windows-only solution. The Windows 3CX CTI client allows you to run a particular executable when an inbound call is received, i.e. when the phone rings. I wanted to pause the manic euro beats so that I could answer my phone and here the caller and uphold professionalism.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
