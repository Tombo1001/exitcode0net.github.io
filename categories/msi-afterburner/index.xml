I recently discussed how I was able to circumvent the Nvidia crypto mining limitations: &lt;a href="__GHOST_URL__/unlock-rtx-3060-mining-hash-rate/">Unlock RTX 3060 mining hash rate&lt;/a> (that post also includes access to the driver). This doubled the RTX 3060 Nicehash mining rate using the ‘unlocked’ Nvidia beta driver – going from ~22MH/s up to ~40MH/s. Impressive!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I am going to share my RTX 3060 overclock settings, which enabled me to achieve a further 10% uplift in Nicehash performance. But first I must disclaimer that you are responsible for your own hardware and any changes you make are at your own risk. What’s more, modern silicone is a lottery, you might not get these exact mining hash rates, or you might get more; keep an eye on your thermals and protect your card and safety of your system accordingly!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
