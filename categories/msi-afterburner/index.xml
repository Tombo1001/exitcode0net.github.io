I recently discussed how I was able to circumvent the Nvidia crypto mining limitations: Unlock RTX 3060 mining hash rate (that post also includes access to the driver). This doubled the RTX 3060 Nicehash mining rate using the ‘unlocked’ Nvidia beta driver – going from ~22MH/s up to ~40MH/s. Impressive!
Now I am going to share my RTX 3060 overclock settings, which enabled me to achieve a further 10% uplift in Nicehash performance.</description></item></channel></rss>
