I have been using the Nextcloud snap package for a long time, but some recent system changes in my colocation facility mean that it is time for a big upgrade. Rather than migrate my existing Nextcloud instance, I have decided to build a new install and here are my goals for the new installation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Use lets encrypt to have automatic and valid HTTPS certificates&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Have the data path for Nextcloud on a HDD and the rest of the host OS on an SSD&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="host-os-details">Host OS Details&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For this setup, I am using Ubuntu 18.04 installed on a 30GB SSD backed partition. I then have a 1TB disk attached and mounted to /media.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
