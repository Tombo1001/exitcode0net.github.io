However to get into that you need to have a specific wireless device which supports monitor mode and packet injection.

This guide is based on Kali Linux 2019.4 â€“ but the drivers are certified for earlier versions of Kali and the kernel that 2019.4 uses. See updates below for getting this working on Kali 2020.4.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
