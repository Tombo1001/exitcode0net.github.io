The manufacturer of the adapter also includes a QR code linking to a easy to follow YouTube video:\nInstallation steps: Remove the surround trim with a trim tool or plastic implement – a screwdriver may leave marks on the plastic trim. Remove 4 T20 screws around the RCD 300 head unit, then pull the RCD 300 out of the dash. Clip the Bluetooth adapter’s white block connector into the bottom left of the block connector (when looking at the back of the head unit). Unscrew the small torx screw on the back of the RCD 300 then screw back in with the small grounding connector between the screw head and the back of the head unit. Plug in the optional microphone and route this to an appropriate position in the vehicle. Reverse the removal steps to secure the head unit and trim in place. The 12 pin VAG connector Using the adapter with the RCD300\nOnce installed, you need to switch the RCD300 to CD mode – press the CD button. Whilst you can still use the unit as a CD player, please remove any CDs before proceeding with these instructions.\nOnce in CD mode, search for available Bluetooth devices on your phone and connect to the available device. Once paired, the RCD 300 should replicate the connection of a CD multi-changer. Tracks on your phone show up as CDs, therefore you can skip tracks with the left and right arrow buttons. These two buttons also control accepting or rejecting incoming calls on the phone. If your vehicle has corresponding steering wheel controls, these will carry out the same functions.\nFrom there onwards, your phone will auto-connect to the Bluetooth device which becomes available after the vehicle ignition is enabled (and the head unit is powered on). I have found that because of the slight delay – 2 seconds – between the device powering on and connecting to the phone, the RCD 300 defaults back to FM/AM, so it is a requirement to press the CD button every time.\nPlaying Spotify over bluetooth from my grubby phone!\n","wordCount":"438","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-06-18T12:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-06-18T12:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tom"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://exitcode0.net/posts/adding-bluetooth-to-a-vw-rcd-300/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ExitCode0","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://exitcode0.net/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://exitcode0.net/ accesskey=h title="ExitCode0 (Alt + H)">ExitCode0</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://datasolace.com/ title=DataSolace><span>DataSolace</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://exitcode0.net/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://exitcode0.net/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://exitcode0.net/privacy/ title=Privacy><span>Privacy</span></a></li><li><a href=https://exitcode0.net/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://exitcode0.net/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://exitcode0.net/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Adding Bluetooth to a VW RCD 300</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-06-18 12:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 18, 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Tom</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#installation aria-label=Installation>Installation</a><ul><ul><li><a href=#installation-steps aria-label="Installation steps:">Installation steps:</a></li></ul></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>I own a basic VW Caddy MK3 (2009) which was equipped with a RCD 300 head unit.
