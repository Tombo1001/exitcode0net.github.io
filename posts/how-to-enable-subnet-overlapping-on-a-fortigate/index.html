A short and sweet problem/resolution. If you are looking to enable subnet overlapping on a Fortigate so that you can give multiple interfaces an IP in the same subnet, this is the post for you.

What is subnet overlapping?
Subnet overlapping is disabled by default in fortiOS and for good reason; if you misuse subnet overlapping it can cause massive routing issues for your clients and their traffic. Subnet overlapping lets you apply IPs from the same subnet (e.g 192.160.1.X/24) to multiple interfaces that are not in the same virtual/physical switch."><meta name=author content="Tom"><link rel=canonical href=https://exitcode0.net/posts/how-to-enable-subnet-overlapping-on-a-fortigate/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://exitcode0.net/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://exitcode0.net/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://exitcode0.net/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://exitcode0.net/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://exitcode0.net/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://exitcode0.net/posts/how-to-enable-subnet-overlapping-on-a-fortigate/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-7745507566538945" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script data-name=BMC-Widget data-cfasync=false src=https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com/1.0.0/widget.prod.min.js data-id=exit data-description="Support me on Buy me a coffee!" data-message="Buy me a coffee" data-color=#FF813F data-position=Right data-x_margin=18 data-y_margin=165></script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-EDE9MPZR9T"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-EDE9MPZR9T")}</script><meta property="og:title" content="How to enable subnet overlapping on a Fortigate"><meta property="og:description" content="
